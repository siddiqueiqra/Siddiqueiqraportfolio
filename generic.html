									<h3>Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!
									</h3>
									<p>Hey there! Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio, where I'm excited to share my journey and showcase my skills and projects in the world of data analysis. So grab a cup of coffee and let's dive in!</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></div>
								<p>They say education is the key to success, and I couldn't agree more. I hold a Diploma in Data Science from the esteemed Boston Institute of Analytics, obtained in 2023. Prior to that, I completed my B.Com degree with flying colors, achieving a remarkable 9.1 CGPI from the University of Mumbai in 2021. But my thirst for knowledge doesn't stop there. I've also earned certificates in Data Science, Machine Learning for Business Challenges, Google Data Analytics, and Statistics for Data Science.</p>
								<p>Transforming my career from the world of commerce to the fascinating realm of data science was undoubtedly a challenging journey. It required immense dedication, hard work, and a burning passion for data analysis. But the effort was worth it.Throughout this transformative journey, I faced numerous challenges, both technical and personal. I had to overcome the initial learning curve, adapt to new tools and programming languages, and constantly challenge myself to think analytically and creatively. However, my passion for data analysis and the desire to make a real difference kept me motivated and determined to succeed. </p>
								<p>Projects are where the real fun begins! I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects that highlight my expertise in data analysis and machine learning.<br>Machine learning is like a superpower in the world of data analysis, and I've dabbled in it quite a bit. My collection of machine learning projects covers a wide range of industries, showcasing my ability to tackle real-world problems using these powerful algorithms. From predicting customer behavior to optimizing business processes, machine learning has become an integral part of my problem-solving toolkit.</p>
								<p>While data analysis keeps me engaged, I also believe in maintaining a well-rounded life. During my downtime, you'll find me indulging in various hobbies. I enjoy expressing myself through poetry and painting, channeling my energy into boxing (my favorite sport), and capturing moments through the lens of my camera. These activities fuel my creativity, provide a much-needed balance, and keep my passion for life alive.</p>
								<p>Looking back on my journey, I am grateful for the decision to transform my career from commerce to data analytics. It has been a fulfilling and rewarding experience, enabling me to blend my passion for numbers with the ever-expanding possibilities of data analysis. Today, I find myself in a profession that not only aligns with my interests but also presents endless opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>
